#### Set up BRFSS dataset

``` r
# Load and clean BRFSS dataset
brfss_df = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, locationdesc, response, data_value) %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response,
                           levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) 

brfss_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10,625 x 5
    ##     year locationabbr locationdesc          response  data_value
    ##    <int> <chr>        <chr>                 <fct>          <dbl>

    ##  3  2010 AL           AL - Jefferson County Good            33.1
    ##  4  2010 AL           AL - Jefferson County Fair            12.5
    ##  5  2010 AL           AL - Jefferson County Poor             5.5

    ##  7  2010 AL           AL - Mobile County    Very good       31.3
    ##  8  2010 AL           AL - Mobile County    Good            31.2
    ##  9  2010 AL           AL - Mobile County    Fair            15.5
    ## 10  2010 AL           AL - Mobile County    Poor             6.4
    ## # ... with 10,615 more rows

The BRFSS dataset contains health-related data from surveys of selected counties within the United States. In this problem, we are primarily focusing on how individuals reported their "Overall Health" from 2002 to 2010. This dataset contains 10625 observations and 5 variables. Key variables include state and county locations, year the observations were taken, responses to the question of overall health (ie. excellent, fair, poor) and proportions of these responses.

#### Subset the dataset into number of locations per state in 2002

We are interested in counting how many locations (counties) were surveyed in each state.

``` r
# Subset brfss dataset by survey locations
# Count number of responses
filter(brfss_df, year == 2002) %>% 
  distinct(locationabbr, locationdesc) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(n == 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| locationabbr |    n|
|:-------------|----:|
| CT           |    7|
| FL           |    7|
| NC           |    7|

In 2002, there were three states (CT, FL, and NC) that obtained survey answers from seven locations.

#### Spaghetti plot

``` r
# Separate dataset into spaghetti plot variables
spaghetti_plot = brfss_df %>% 
  distinct(locationabbr, locationdesc, year) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())

# Create spaghetti_plot 
spaghetti_plot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = locationabbr)) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Location", 
    discrete = TRUE
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of locations by state, 2002-2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Locations",
    caption = "BRFSS Dataset"
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.box = "horizontal")
```

![](p8105_hw3_azz2107_files/figure-markdown_github/spaghetti_plot-1.png)

Most states were surveyed at 10 or fewer locations. A couple states had been surveyed between 10 and 20 locations. There were two extreme cases where two states were surveyed at 40+ locations in 2007 and 2010.

#### Descriptive variables "Excellent" proportions across New York State in 2002, 2006, and 2010

``` r
# Summarize descriptive variables to make a table
brfss_df %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2002, 2006, 2010), 
         response == "Excellent", 
         locationabbr == "NY") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_excellent = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE),
            std_excellent = sd(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

|  year|  mean\_excellent|  std\_excellent|
|-----:|----------------:|---------------:|
|  2002|         24.04000|        4.486424|
|  2006|         22.53333|        4.000833|
|  2010|         22.70000|        3.567212|

Between 2002, 2006, and 2010 the average proportion of "excellent" responses does not differ by much. The highest average occured in 2002 with 24.04% responding they had excellent health and a standard deviation of 4.48%. Meanwhile, the lowest average occured in 2006 with 22.53% responding they had excellent health and a standard deviation of 4.00%.

#### Five-panel plot, distribution of responses

``` r
# Summarize average proportions of each response 
response_df = brfss_df %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr, response) %>% 
  summarize(mean_prop = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot distributions in five panels
response_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_prop, color = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = year)) + 
  facet_grid(.~response) + 
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of response proportions by state-level, 2002-2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "State level averages (%)",
    caption = "BRFSS dataset"
  ) + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Location", 
    discrete = TRUE
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60))
```

![](p8105_hw3_azz2107_files/figure-markdown_github/response_df-1.png)

Overall, year to year we see that response proportions remain around the same percentage. The highest proportions of responses fall under "Very good", "Good", and "Excellent" categories. The lowest proportions of responses fall under "Fair" and "Poor" categories. There also appears to be slightly more variance in the "Poor" category with more outliers. Based off of this figure, we might be able to conclude that between 2002 and 2010, Americans generally felt at least good or even better of their overall health.

Instacart is an online grocery shopping company, and the instacard dataset contains information on online grocery orders from their customers. The instacart dataset includes 1384617 observations and 15 variables. Some of these key variables include product name, food aisle information (name, number, department), time or order (day of the week, hour of the day, days since last ordered). For example, there are 21 departments which include snacks, frozen foods, and dairy and eggs. On average, most customers will make orders on 2.7013918 day, which according to the datasets key is between Tuesday or Wednesday. The most popular time to place orders is at 13.5775922 hours.

#### Aisle information

There are 134 aisles in this dataset. Some examples of these include yogurt, fresh vegetables, and specialty cheeses. The aisle with the most counts of order. Most items are ordered from the fresh vegetable, fresh fruit, and packaged vegetables and fruits aisles.

``` r
# Group by aisles and summarize counts
aisle_count = instacart_df %>% 
  group_by(aisle, department) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 
  
aisle_count

    ## # ... with 124 more rows

**Aisle Count Plot**

``` r
# Plot distribution of items ordered from each aisle
ggplot(aisle_count, aes(x = log(n), y = aisle)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = department)) + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(department), scales = "free", space = "free") + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of items ordered by aisle",
    x = "Log(Number of items ordered)",
    y = "Aisle name"
  ) + 
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7)) 
```

![](p8105_hw3_azz2107_files/figure-markdown_github/plot_aisle_count-1.png)

Based off of this figure, the most popular products fall under produce (fresh vegetables and fruits) as well as dairy (yogurt and packaged cheese). Some of the least bought products include baby accessories and baby bath/body care, beauty products, and frozen juice.

#### Popular aisle items

``` r
# Subset and group instacart_df to products of interest
# Count products and then rank them to see most popular purchases
instacart_df %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", 
                      "dog food care", 
                      "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(product_rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(product_rank == 1) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

The NY NOAA dataset records weather and climate related information from the weather stations located in New York state, between 1980 to 2010. This dataset has 2595176 observations and 9 variables. Some key variables include weather station ID, date, precipitation amounts (precipitation, snowfall, snow depth), and temperatures (minimum and maximum). For example, the average snowfall in 2007 was 0.7436284 mm. That same year, the average minimum temperature recorded in thiswas 2.8787028 deg C. The average maximum temperature recorded in 2007 was NA deg C. It should be noted, that there are a significant amount of missing data in this dataset. For example, the following percentages are proportions of missing values for a couple of variables:
\* 5.62% of precipitation variables have missing values.
\* 43.71% of maximum temperature values have missing values.
\* 14.69% of snowfall measurements have missing values.

#### Maximum temperature

``` r
tmax_plot = ny_noaa_df %>%
  filter(month %in% c(1, 7), !(is.na(tmax))) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = c(1,7), labels = c("January", "July"))) %>% 
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  summarize(mean_max_temp = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE))

tmax_plot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_max_temp)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = id)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  facet_grid(.~month) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Location", 
    discrete = TRUE
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Average maximum temperatures by weather station, 1980 - 2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average maximum temperature (deg C)",
    caption = "NY NOAA Dataset")
```

![](p8105_hw3_azz2107_files/figure-markdown_github/tmax_plot-1.png)

In January, the average maximum temperature was significantly lower than in July as one would expect. Over the years, the average maximum temperature in January fluctuates frequently. In comparison, July saw a pretty constant average maximum temperature over the years. There are perhaps a couple of unusual years, in January 1994 and 2004 there were some incredibly cold winters. In July, there is one weather station record that stands out as an outlier. Around 1997 or 1998, one weather station reported a very low average maximum temperature at around 14 deg C.

#### Two panel temperature and snowfall plots

``` r
# Create a hexplot to compare tmin and tmax
noaa_hexplot = ny_noaa_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) +
  geom_hex() + 
  labs(
    x = "Minimum temperature (deg C)",
    y = "Maximum temperature (deg C)"
  )

# Create a barplot of snowfall by year
noaa_barplot = ny_noaa_df %>% 
  filter(snow > 0 & snow < 100) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = snow, group = year)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Snowfall (cm)"
    )

noaa_hexplot + noaa_barplot
```

    ## Warning: Removed 1136276 rows containing non-finite values (stat_binhex).

From the maximum temperature vs. minimum temperature plot, a higher minimum temperature is correlated with a higher maximum temperature on the same day. Additionally, the most common temperatures correlated with each other is in the light blue area of the graph where minimum temperature ranges from approximated -15 deg C to 15 deg C and maximum temperature ranges from approximated -10 deg C to 30 deg C. Where the plot is dark colored, there are outliers. For example there was a day where minimum temperature was around 50 deg C and the maximum temperature was 0 deg C. This may resulted from data input error.

In the distribution of snowfall by year plot, there does not appear to be much difference or change in the amount of snowfall between 1980 to 2010. This plot does show that there is variance from year to year. Some years have extreme outliers. 2002 and 2008 are some examples of this, where there are several large values for snowfall.
